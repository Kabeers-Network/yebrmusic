        # Abstract
        Optical character recognition (OCR) is an
        important technique for solving many technical
        problems. As a few examples, OCR has been
        used for digitizing books, identifying license
        plates, and assisting the vision impaired. In this
        report, we present an Android mobile application that
        uses OCR to recognize and evaluate arithmetic expressions.
        The app could be used to help students check their
        solutions to challenging problems quickly and easily.

        # Introduction

        While developing our App, we found a
        related app called Photomath. The Photomath app
        requires the user to manually place a bounding
        box around the text of the equation, and we found
        the execution time to be somewhat slow (often a
        few seconds for a simple expression).
        Furthermore, Photomath can only solve a single
        equation at a time. Our App addresses each of
        these shortcomings.

        Currently, Our App can automatically detect
        multiple equations on a light background,
        display bounding boxes around each
        equation, and solve the equations independently.
        However, in our experience, Our App does not
        yet recognize text, particularly handwritten text,
        as accurately as Photomath.

        Furthermore, Our App is currently limited to arithmetic
        expressions involving integers 0-9 and the following
        characters: “+-()/x”. We plan to address these issues
        in our future work.

        # Implementation
        The application’s pipeline can be broken up
        into six segments: keypoint detection, equation
        bounding, thresholding, character recognition,
        evaluation, and display.
